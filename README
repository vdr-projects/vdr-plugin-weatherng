See the file COPYING for license information.

Description:
=============
10 days weather forecast 

For now have a look in the german README.DE , only short description here;)

Short (and maybe not completed) way:

You need imlib2 or imagemagick (tested with newest one, see info in "Makefile").

Unpack and Compile the plugin (see VDR docs).
Copy whole folder "weatherng" to $PLUGINCONFIGDIR
Edit "weatherng.sh".
Start VDR with "-P weatherng".


optional :
Commandline parameters : -D --data  -I --images -S --script -C --config

-D = Path to your data and radarmaps (data1.xml)
-I = Path to folder "images"
-S = Path to weatherng.sh
-C = Path to config ( e.g /etc/vdr/plugins )

If you dont set parameters , the default for them are:
$PLUGINCONFIG/weatherng



=================================================================================
Before you use the examples of URLs in weatherng.sh ,you agree with the "Terms of Use" from
"The Weather Channel" , short TWC , which you can found at http://www.weather.com 
and that you have the permission to use the downloaded files.
The same for copyrighted radarmaps.
=================================================================================

Then start VDR again with  or without commandline parameter (-P weatherng).
Goto setup and change what you like.


To get your Station Id move with your internetbrowser to :
http://www.weather.com
Type in the name of your town (e.g. "London" and hit enter.
Now have a look at the link for your town which you hopefully got after you hit return.
If you dont got one , try with a bigger town next to you.
For "Herne, Germany" you get something like ....GMXX0056.... .
so GMXX0056 is the StationId for you if you live in "Herne,Germany" ;)


Key RIGHT                    : day forward or next radarmap
Key LEFT                     : previous day or previous radarmap
Key Back/Escape              : back to forecast or ext
the oher are selfexplaining.....

If you dont update , you wont see any radarmaps/weatherdata.
So press  green Key "Refresh" after first run.
